# LGP-for-DL
This repo will soon implement a genetic algorithm (linear genetic programming) for hyper parameter optimization of neural networks of different kinds. The most interesting part is if LGP can be used for deciding on network structure, typ of layers, number of layers, connections, regularization, etc.
